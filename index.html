<h4>
Earth's mightiest heroes and protectors, The Avengers is the ultimate group of people and always try to do good by others. Of course, over the years they have done a lot of good within the movies, but they've also caused plenty of damage along the way, and not all of their personalities are necessarily the nicest.
<br>
But even though they've all proven to be popular with moviegoers, which of them are the most likable?

<li>Highly acrobatic, Steve Rogers is able to pull off surprisingly agile moves for a man his size.</li>

<li>An onboard AI system – originally JARVIS, then replaced by FRIDAY – helps Tony control his armor and connect to other systems.</li>

<li>One of many specialized suits, the Hulkbuster armor is a highly durable, incredibly strong suit that allows Stark to go toe to toe with the teammate for which it is named.</li>
